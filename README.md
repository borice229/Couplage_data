**Data-Model Coupling**

Simulations and forecasts of complex phenomena (weather forecasting, floods, disease evolutions...) require the construction of a model capable of managing and adapting to this complexity and extracting complex information from noisy data. The objective of this project is to practice the concept of model-data coupling and its use for statistical learning.
